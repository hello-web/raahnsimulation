Real-Time Autoencoder Augmented Hebbian Network(RAAHN) Simulation
=================================================================

Description
===========
RAAHN Simulation is a simulator for testing, developing, and displaying the Real-Time Autoencoder Augmented Hebbian Network algorithm. The simulation consists of a car driving along a road, and learning through the principles of reinforcement learning (through hebbian learning) and an autoencoder.

Building
========
To be added soon.
